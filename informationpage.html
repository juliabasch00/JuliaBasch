        The Love Island entertainment series has suffered major backlash in the past couple years because of their pattern with depression and suicide. Throughout the season, audience members/fans watch contestants basically 24/7. Because of this, contestants return home after their season with many new social media followers. This has proved to lead to terrible declines in mental health for certain stars. Three Love Island members have sadly passed away due to suicide just in the past three years. Learn more about them and their stories below.
